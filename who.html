    <h2>Roadscape Odyssey Series</h2>
    <p><em>Roadscape Odyssey</em> is an indie meta-horror point-and-click game series created by Mayci. The games begin as seemingly innocent point-and-click adventures where players select the correct road directions; incorrect choices lead to a game over followed by an unexpected shift into horror themes.</p>

    <p>Two games in the series have been released: <em>Roadscape Odyssey</em> and <em>Roadscape Odyssey 2: The Road Extends</em>. The third game, <em>Roadscape Odyssey III: Crossed Paths</em>, is currently in development and is expected to expand on the series’ lore.</p>

    <h2>Development History</h2>
    <p>The series originated from a demo made in 2023 submitted for the LuigikidEXEChallenge. After missing the submission deadline, the demo was released for fun on the (now-abandoned) 'Protag Dev Studios' Discord server, but the concept remained dormant until late 2023, when Mayci launched the itch.io page for the first game, and was inspired to make more games.</p>

    <p>The finalised first game was released in April 2024. After initial attempts to sell the game commercially were unsuccessful, Mayci decided to make the games free to play going forward.</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Mayci has openly discussed her past use of cracked software, such as FL Studio, and is known for her candid and authentic communication style.</p>
